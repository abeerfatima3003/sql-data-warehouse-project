🏗️ **Data Architecture**
---
The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture **Bronze**, **Silver**, **Gold** Layers:

1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
2. **Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleaning, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer**: Houses business-ready data modeled into a **Star Schema** required for reporting and analytics.
